# How To Translate:

To translate: two files, 4500 words in total.

1. *POST A GITHUB ISSUE letting folks know you're working on a translation.* This helps prevent conflict/multiple competing translations, and helps *you* find collaborators for the translation process!
2. Find [the two-letter code of your target language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). Examples: FranÃ§ais â†’ "fr", ä¸­æ–‡ â†’ "zh"
3. Make a copy of `index.md`, and rename the file `[your 2-letter code].md`. Translate your file! Export it to html somewhere.
4. Make a copy of `index.html`, and rename the file `[your 2-letter code].html`. Translate the `<head></head>` parts, then paste your exported html from Step 2 where it says to paste it.
5. Make a Pull Request! (I am slow to respond, so you may have to wait a while before your translation is live)
6. Party ðŸŽ‰
